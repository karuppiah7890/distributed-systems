I was looking for the free ebook I noticed on Microsoft Azure website. I found many other Microsoft links that provides the same ebook - `Designing Distributed Systems: Patterns And Paradigms For Scalable, Reliable Services by Brendan Burns`

Paid one - https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Distributed-Systems-Patterns-Paradigms/dp/1491983647

I figured I'll give it a read sometime :)

So, I found these links 

https://microsoft.cloudnativecommunity.com/designing-distributed-systems/

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/designing-distributed-systems/

http://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-eBook-DesigningDistributedSystems.pdf

I had used the Azure one previously

I also found a presentation PDF by Brendan Burns

https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or-2018/cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/274/Designing%20distributed%20systems_%20Patterns%20and%20practices%20for%20reliable%20software%20systems%20Presentation.pdf

Looking at the URL, looks like a Oreilly conference - OSCON 2018? It's based on the `Designing Distributed Systems: Patterns And Paradigms For Scalable, Reliable Services by Brendan Burns` book

I was looking for the talk

I noticed some Distributed Systems related conferences. Atleast it looks like Velocity is one -

Looks like I can find Oreilly videos here

Looks like not all videos are present in https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL055Epbe6d5aZWAIiV9Ie8SOFMe4IGlLI

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=OSCON+2018

Anyways, looks like I can't find it. I guess it's okay. In the quest I found some related distributed systems stuff! So :)
