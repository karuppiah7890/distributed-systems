# July 31st 2021

Today I was wandering around and looking for games around distributed systems to see if I can do something fun ;)

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=distributed+systems+games&ia=web

I stumbled upon a result where I found akamai has published a paper on a Virtualized Game for Teaching about Distributed Systems. And that's exactly the kind of thing I was looking for!! :D But then, I was looking for a game, and not a research paper

https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/technical-publication/virtualized-games-for-teaching-about-distributed-systems-technical-publication.pdf

I also stumbled upon a cool awesome list :D

https://github.com/theanalyst/awesome-distributed-systems

Every other result was about distributed systems for gaming, and distributed architecture for games etc

I need better search keywords :P

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=games+teaching+distributed+systems&t=ffab&ia=web

https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=games%20teaching%20distributed%20systems

https://www.google.com/search?q=games+around+distributed+systems

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=games+teaching+distributed+systems+concepts&ia=web

Couldn't find any games, damn

I did find more awesome lists and stuff

https://github.com/search?q=distributed-systems

https://github.com/feixiao/Distributed-Systems

https://github.com/rShetty/awesome-distributed-systems

https://github.com/search?q=awesome+distributed+systems

https://github.com/zhenlohuang/awesome-distributed-systems

https://github.com/gojek/awesome-distributed-systems

https://github.com/FedericoPonzi/awesome-distributed-systems

https://github.com/cizixs/awesome-raft

I also stumbled upon something that I noticed long ago

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-thorough-introduction-to-distributed-systems-3b91562c9b3c/

Also stumbled upon

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing

Checking out https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing?specialization=cloud-computing course, I'm simply auditing the course because I hardly pay for learning and usually just use free and open for anyone material which is out in the public on the Internet

I just finished reading https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-thorough-introduction-to-distributed-systems-3b91562c9b3c/ . It was very very interesting :D

I want to check in-depth about each of the links mentioned in the article https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-thorough-introduction-to-distributed-systems-3b91562c9b3c/ . Atleast most or quite a few of them, if not all

As part of that, I'm reading this first

https://www.oreilly.com/content/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/

Next I was reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID

And there's more to read [TODO]
