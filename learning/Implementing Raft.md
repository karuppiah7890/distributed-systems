Based on my plan, I started reading

https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/implementing-raft-part-0-introduction/

and the first thing it said was

> I assume you've read the Raft paper at least once; in addition it's highly recommended to spend some time perusing the resources on the Raft website - watch a talk or two by its creators, play with the visualization, skim Ongaro's PhD thesis for more details, etc.

So...I guess it makes sense, because the post is named as "implementation"

So I'm going to read the Raft research paper once at least :)

https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf

Long ago a colleague (https://github.com/dineshba) tried to explain it in a session in two parts. But it was long ago and I don't remember much now. So I guess it's gonna be a fresh start ;)
