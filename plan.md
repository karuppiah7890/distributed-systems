# Plan

Following https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/how-i-am-learning-distributed-systems-7eb69b4b51bd

Start with the series of blog posts about Raft

https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/implementing-raft-part-0-introduction/

Try the code at https://github.com/eliben/raft and learn by
- Running it
- Changing the code
- Running the tests
- Adding new tests / modifying existing tests and running them to see how things work and answer questions I have

Come up with a set of questions that I have while learning

Next Steps? ðŸ¤”

Currently I'm looking at other various ways to learn too. Raft implementation has been on hold a bit.

Other ways - reading articles, but that's just theoretical, yeah. Totally these are the ways -

- Reading articles - theoretical and sometimes practical too if there's code or mention about real life experiences
- Reading blogs and blog posts - theoretical and sometimes practical too if there's code or mention about real life experiences
- Contributing to Open Source projects or even closed source projects - very practical and some theory too that will be needed to do things so I'll learn it on the way
- Reading books / ebooks - theoretical and sometimes practical too if there's code or mention about real life experiences
- Reading research papers - theoretical and sometimes practical too if there's code or mention about real life experiences
- Trying out YouTube and other videos and video series - theoretical and sometimes practical too if there's code or mention about real life experiences
- Trying out Online Courses - video and non-video, for example Coursera courses, college online courses - theoretical and sometimes practical too if there's code or mention about real life experiences
- Listening to podcasts - theoretical and sometimes practical too if there's mention about code in audio, but it's probably very very rare, or there couldn be mention about real life experiences which is very practical knowledge
- Attending meetups - online and offline - theoretical and sometimes practical too if there's code or mention about real life experiences

Three broad mediums for learning
- Audio
- Video
- Text

There's also interaction / collaboration with people as part of the mediums. Interactions - discussions, question and answer forums etc. Collaboration - working together and collaborating on some project
