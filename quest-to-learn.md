# Quest to Learn

I have been on a quest to find a structure to learn Distributed Systems and learn it in a structure - theoretically and practically

I want to learn about distributed systems and also specifically about distributed databases

Some of the high level questions I want to answer are
- What is a distributed system?
- What kind of distributed systems are people building today?
- What are the concepts behind the different distributed systems?
- How do people test distributed systems?
- Research papers behind distributed systems? Current and old ones
- How do people "scale" with the help of distributed systems?
- What kind of problems does a distributed system solve? and how does it solve it?
- How do people monitor and observe distributed systems?
- How do people manage distributed systems at scale? Manually? Automated fashion? Manage as in - install, configure, re-configure, update system (software) version, delete some nodes, add some nodes, backup and/ snapshot of data, restoring data from backup and/ snapshot, force failovers if it's possible in case there's a concept of "leader"

And everything else around distributed systems - patterns about distributed systems and more ! :)
